This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
a<-c(1,NA+1L,"c") #character
b<-c(1L/0,NA) #double
c<-c(1:3,5) #double
d<-c(3L,NaN+1L) #double
e<-c(NA,TRUE) #logical
```

```{r}
typeof(a)
typeof(b)
typeof(c)
typeof(d)
typeof(e)

```
