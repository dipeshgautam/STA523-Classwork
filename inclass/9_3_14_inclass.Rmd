### Exercise 1 (Example)

```{r}
a <- c(1, NA+1L, "C") #character because "C" is a string and trumps all
b<- c(1L/0,NA) #double because 1L/0 returns infinity which is a double
c<- c(1:3,5) #double
d<- c(3L, NaN+1L) #double because NaN is a double
e<- c(NA,TRUE) #Logical because both are logical
```


###Exercise 2
```{r}
str(list("firstName"="John","lastName"="Smith","age"=25,"address"=list("streetAddress"="21 2nd Street", "city"="New York", "state"="NY","postalCode"=10021), "phoneNumber"=list(list("type"="home", "number"="212 555-1239"),list("type"="fax", "number"="646 555-4567"))))
```


####Exercise 3
```{r}
x <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
attr(x,"class")=c("sunny","cloudy","rain","snow")
attr(x,"levels")=c(1,2,3,4)
attr(x,"class")="factor"
str(x)
```
