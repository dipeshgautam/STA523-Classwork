### Exercise 1

```{r}
a <- c(1, NA+1L, "C") 
b<- c(1L/0,NA) 
c<- c(1:3,5)
d<- c(3L, NaN+1L) 
e<- c(NA,TRUE) 
```
*A is a character because "C" is a string and trumps all

*B is a double because 1L/0 returns infinity which is a double

*C is a double

*D is a double because NaN is a double

*E is logical because both NA and TRUE are logicals

###Exercise 2
```{r}
str(list("firstName"="John","lastName"="Smith","age"=25,"address"=list("streetAddress"="21 2nd Street", "city"="New York", "state"="NY","postalCode"=10021), "phoneNumber"=list(list("type"="home", "number"="212 555-1239"),list("type"="fax", "number"="646 555-4567"))))
```


###Exercise 3
```{r}
weather = as.integer(c(3,1,3,3,2,4,1))
attr(weather,"levels") = c("sunny","cloudy","rain","snow")
attr(weather, "class")="factor"
str(weather)
```
